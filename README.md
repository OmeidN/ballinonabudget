# BallinOnABudget

**BallinOnABudget** is a full-stack web application that helps users save time and money while grocery shopping. Based on the user's location and grocery list, the app scrapes current prices and deals from nearby stores, then generates three optimized shopping strategies:

### 🔍 Features

- **Money Saver** – Minimizes total cost by shopping across multiple stores.
- **Balanced Saver** – Recommends the best route based on a mix of cost and travel time.
- **Time Saver** – One-stop shop strategy with the lowest total price.

### ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind, Vite
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas via Mongoose
- **Scraping**: Puppeteer (for JavaScript-heavy grocery websites)
- **AI Parsing**: Gemini API (to extract structured item/price data from scraped content)
- **Location Services**: Google Maps Distance Matrix API

### 📦 How It Works

1. Users create a grocery list in the app.
2. The backend uses **Google Maps API** to find nearby grocery stores.
3. For each store:
   - **Puppeteer** scrapes the weekly ad or pricing page
   - **Gemini API** extracts item names, prices, and deals into structured JSON
   - Data is stored in **MongoDB Atlas**
4. The app uses pricing and distance data to return three optimized strategies.
